#Decryption


In essence, the program needs to test all possible shifts and count
the number of valid words.

The best shift becomes the shift with the higher number of valid words.


Pseudocode
#Create a dictionary to store the shift and number of valid words.

#For all possible shifts (0 to 25).
		
	#Use applyshift method to decrypte the text.
	
	#Store decrypted text in a list (consider using string.split function)
	
	#For all possible words in the list, check to see if word is valid (use isWord function).
	
		#Count the number of valid words and store it in dictionary


#Using the dictionary, return the shift with the highest number of valid words.
